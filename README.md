This script uses the GitHub API to scan followers and following of a user and then unfollows all people that don't follow them back (this can be customized and it is possible to whitelist certain users) and follows back people the user isn't following. This is a nice way to balance followers and following, and not anger people you don't follow back while also not ruining your profile's look by making your following higher than it should be!
